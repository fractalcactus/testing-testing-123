**`backend`** contains a representation of a ruby backend, but it's really just a couple of ruby scripts.
- After installing the specied version of ruby, and running `bundle` to install gems, `rspec` to run the tests
**`frontend/elements`** was created using 'create react app'
- `npm i` to install node modules
- `npm start` to run the front end on a local port (terminal output will tell you which one)
- `npm run tests` to run the tests
